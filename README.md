## Warning
This plugin is WIP and isn't stable 

## How do I wrap content around an image and vice versa?
You don't.  It's as simple as that.  Etherpad is a line based editor meaning having lines wrap around other lines will be a mess.  We're not willing to accommodate this as your users will end up making messy horrible documents and you will feel bad.

# TODO:
 - [x] Find someone to sponsor development
 - [x] Make it work on develop branch (see https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/pull/2497/files)
 - [x] Support image resize
 - [x] Support image drag and drop
 - [x] Fix IE being able to resize image IE problems....  Y'know...
 -Should be fixed now, needs testing
 - [x] Fix mobile issue where mouseout never fires so resize is always shown
 -Should be a relatively easy fix but will require handling aceEditEvent events
 - [x] Show span as active on click of "control" element
 - [x] Fix issue when a user selects content then hits paste (it currently throws up an error and breaks editing)
 -Creating a new line "might" fix this but other than that I don't have any other ideas other than inserting a special character
 - [x] Support image drag and drop to already populated lines (it currently does not allow the image to be uploaded to this point, imho it should create a new line with the image on)
 -Hopefully creating a "new line" event should fix this
 - [x] Fix issue with large images being distorted

 - [x] BUG: ALL: Fix copy/paste within editor creating 2 copies Currently if you copy/paste an image inside the pad <-- Seems to create n copies based on number of line breaks that have been copied IE if <img><br> is copied it will create 2 copies.  The fix here is to use cc.doAttrib probably assuming that applies attrib on a line and not a selection
 - [x] BUG: ALL: Fix copy/paste creating two copies when copying from web browser
 - [x] BUG: ALL: Fix issue where dragging and dropping in same location nukes the imag (easy to fix in all browsers except firefox, see below)

 - [x] BUG: FIREFOX: Fix issue with Firefox not being able to drag an image UP towards the top of the pad due to race condition (firefox thinks start and end position is always the same)
 - [x] BUG: IE/CHROME: Drag and Drop from File system wont import image (Chrome bug) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23548745/drag-and-drop-image-file-into-contenteditable-div-works-fine-in-ff-fails-miser
 - [x] BUG: IE: Unable to drag an drop contens in a pad
 - [x] BUG: FIREFOX/IE: Copy/Pasting text and images only pastes text
 - [ ] BUG: ALL: Image size is lost on cut/copy/paste & drag/drop
 - [ ] MINOR BUG: ALL: Drag and Drop onto line ONE LINE ABOVE WITH CONTENT doesn't remove old content -- Because the DOM is rewritten the line number is changed..  I'm a bit unsure how to fix this
 - [ ] MINOR BUG: ALL: Under certain (I don't know what yet) conditions an image can get distorted (x/y) -- I need steps to replicate really

#V2:
 - [ ] OPTIMIZE: Put images on the file system with links instead of in the pad as Base64 Encoded
 - [ ] FUNCTIONALITY: Support Export fully
 - [ ] UX: Disable Drag/resize handles in IE (see https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/Feedback/Details/907422)
 - [ ] FEATURE: ALL: Consider file upload experience (if we want to provide that) (see https://github.com/JohnMcLear/ep_copy_paste_images/issues/3) --- Seeing ep_fileupload we can probably leverage this and store images on the server

#VNever:
 - [ ] Support wrap around image (This will never happen)
 - [x] Use the shadow DOM for handles (See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23882272/contenteditable-in-shadow-dom)
